# pyclamster
The **PY**thon **CL**oud c**AM**era **STER**eo analysis system is a Python
module to post-process cloud camera images. The post-processing includes image
manipulation, processing and matching.
</br>This repository is in the alpha state and will be expanded with time.

**Structure**
<li>doc: Folder for the documentation.
<li>examples: Example scripts.
<li>interna: Internas (e.g. helpful links).
<li>pyclamster: The package main folder.
<li>scripts: The scripts to run an operational system

**Planned**
<li>Different filters to filter things out of a camera image.
<li>Clustering methods to cluster the image into different classes and to
cluster clouds into different cloud cluster.
<li>Matching methods to match the images between two cameras and between to
time steps.
<li>Locating methods to locate a cloud in coordinates.
